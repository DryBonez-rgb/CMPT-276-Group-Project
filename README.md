# **Group 16's project for CMPT 276 Summer 2021**

Proposal Document

Project Name: **ReadME**

Date: **06/25/2021**

**ReadME** is an E-commerce unfamous author incubator that allows unfamous authors to start risk-free and allows students to trade their secondhand textbooks without the effort of self-advertising in any messenger/discord group chats.

* By signing up and login to ReadME would gain user access to all features: 
  * printing
  * posting
  * selling
  * buying
  * review
  * loyalty
  * points
  * and more..

* Price is never fixed for any books selling on ReadME, buyers may (and would be welcomed to) negotiate price with the seller
* Speaking about API, if the book is delivered through postal services, a shipping fee estimation would be included based on the calculation of distance too.
  * Which would be using the open API Google Maps
* As for the competitors we have nowadays, we have the strengths of all-in-one bookstore
* To give the hidden gems a chance to shine, we would not sell the “best-sellers”
* To make this website perfect, with all the features we desire, the work would be enough for five group members

* Sample story: An SFU student finishes their Calculus 1 course just to be stuck with a now useless textbook. Rather than throw it away or try to advertise it yourself, turn a profit using ReadME, save the prospective buyer money with below retail pricing, get some money back, then use the points you acquired for a new textbook or another product of your choosing!

# **Some quick answers to questions regarding the Project:** 
#### How is this problem solved currently (if at all)?
Amazon (Kindle), Discord(second-hand textbook selling channel), Archive of Our Own(for easy publishing), stockX(bidding). 

#### How will this project make life better? Is it educational or just for entertainment? 
It will make purchases easier and selling too. It is a convenience for students who will have an organized and dedicated space for selling their used textbooks. It is also a reprieve for small authors to sell their books without competition from large authors and publishers.

#### Who is the target audience? Who will use your app?
Small authors and individuals/students (for selling), and people who don’t want to buy books/textbooks at retail price.

#### Does this project have many individual features, or one main feature (possibility with many subproblems)? These are the ‘epics’ of your project.
It has a lot of sub-features working towards one purpose -- selling or buying.
